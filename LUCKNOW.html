Lucknow is the capital city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and is also the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and division.
 It is the fourteenth-most populous city and the twelfth-most populous urban agglomeration of India. Lucknow has always been a multicultural city
 that flourished as a North Indian cultural and artistic hub, and the seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries. It continues to be an
 important centre of governance, administration, education, commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, design, culture, tourism,
 music and poetry. The city stands at an elevation of approximately 123 metres (404 ft) above sea level. Lucknow district covers an area of 2,528 
square kilometres (976 sq. mi). Bounded on the east by Barabanki, on the west by Unnao, on the south by Raebareli and in the north by Sitapur and
 Hardoi, Lucknow sits on the north-western shore of the River. Historically, Lucknow was the capital of the Awadh region, controlled by the Delhi 
Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire. It was transferred to the Nawabs of Awadh. In 1856, the British East India Company abolished local rule and 
took complete control of the city along with the rest of Awadh and, in 1857, transferred it to the British Raj. Along with the rest of India, Lucknow
became independent from Britain on 15 August 1947. It has been listed as the 17th-fastest growing city in India and 74th in the world. Lucknow, 
along with Agra and Varanasi, is in the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a chain of survey triangulations created by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to
boost tourism in the state.

Chota Imambara, also known as Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak is an imposing monument located in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. Built
as an imambara or a congregation hall for Shia Muslims, by Muhammad Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh in 1838,[1] it was to serve as a mausoleum for
himself and his mother, who is buried beside him. The significance of Panjetan, the holy five, is once again emphasized here with five main doorways.
This Imambara consist of two halls and a Shehnasheen (a platform where the Zarih of Imam Husain is kept.) Zarih is the replica of that protective grill
or structure which is kept on the grave of Imam Husain at Karbala, Iraq. The large green and white bordered hall of Azakhana is richly decorated
with chandeliers and a good number of crystal glass lamp-stands. In fact, it was for this profuse decoration that the Imambara was referred by
European visitors and writers as The Palace of Lights. The exterior is very beautifully decorated with Quranic verses in Islamic calligraphy.<br><br>
