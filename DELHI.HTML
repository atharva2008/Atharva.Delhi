Delhi , officially known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.
It is bordered by the state of Haryana on three sides (NORTH, SOUTH AND WEST) and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. The NCT covers an area of 1,484
square kilometres (573 sq. mi. Delhi's urban area is now considered to extend beyond the NCT boundaries, and include the neighbouring satellite cities of 
Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area called the National Capital Region (NCR) and had an estimated 2016 population of over 26 million
people, making it the world's second-largest urban area according to the United Nations. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have
ranked Delhi either the most or second-most productive metro area of India. Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai and is home to
18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires. Delhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index. Delhi has the
second-highest GDP per capita in India. Delhi is of great historical significance as an important commercial, transport, and cultural hub, as well as the
political centre of India. Delhi has been continuously inhabited since the 6th century BCE. Through most of its history, Delhi has served as a capital of
various kingdoms and empires, most notably the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. The city has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt several times,
particularly during the medieval period, and modern Delhi is a cluster of a number of cities spread across the metropolitan region. For many centuries Delhi
has been a dominant trading and commercial centre in northern India, and after 1990s it has emerged as an important node in the international corporate
and financial network. A union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own
legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of
India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi.

The Diwan-i-Khas, or Hall of Private Audiences, was a chamber in the Red Fort of Delhi built in 1648 as a location for receptions. It was the location where the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan received courtiers and state guests. It was also known as the Shah Mahal.
A gate on the north side of the preceding Diwan-i-Am audience hall led to the innermost court of the palace called Jalau Khana and the Diwan-i-Khas. Originally there were two enclosures on the west of the hall, one for the nobles and the other for those of a lower rank.
Diwan-i-Khas measures 90 x 67 feet. It consists of a rectangular central chamber, surrounded by a series of arches rising from marble piers. The lower parts of the piers are inlaid with floral designs, while the upper portions are painted and gilded. The four corners of the roof are surmounted by pillared chhatri.

The India Gate (originally the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath. It stands as a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in between 1914–1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the
Near and the Far East, and the third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome,
and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts.
The memorial-gate is also a popular spot for protests by the civil society in New Delhi.

The iron pillar of Delhi is a structure 23 feet 8 inches (7.2 metres) high with 16 inches diameter that was constructed by a "King Chandra", probably Chandragupta II (reigned c. 375-415 CE), and now stands in the Qutb complex at Mehrauli in Delhi, India. It is famous for the rust-resistant composition of the metals
used in its construction. The pillar weighs over 3,000 kg (7,000 lb) and is thought to have been erected elsewhere, perhaps outside the Udayagiri Caves, and moved to its present location early in the Delhi Sultanate. The pillar carries a number of inscriptions of different dates, some of which have not been studied
systematically despite the pillar's prominent location and easy access. The oldest inscription on the pillar is that of a king named Chandra (IAST: Candra), generally identified as the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II.

Jantar Mantar is located in the modern city of New Delhi. It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. The site is one of five built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from 1723 onwards, revising the calendar and astronomical tables. There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the Jantar Mantar observatory
in New Delhi that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710. Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of construction. Its height is 723 feet (220 m).The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and
movements of the sun, moon and planets. Some of these purposes nowadays would be classified as astronomy.Completed in 1724, the Delhi Jantar Mantar had decayed considerably by 1867. The Ram Yantra, the Samrat Yantra, the Jai Prakash Yantra and the Misra Yantra are the distinct instruments of Jantar Mantar.

The Qutub Minar, is a victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of New Delhi, India. The height of Qutub Minar is 72.5 meters, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks. The tower tapers and has a 14.3 metres (47 feet) base diameter, reducing to
2.7 metres (9 feet) at the top of the peak. It contains a spiral staircase of 379 steps. Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns;
in Delhi the shaft is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In general minarets were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.

The Red Fort is a historic fort in the city of Delhi (in Old Delhi) in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned reconstruction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to 
architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. It was reconstructed between May 1639 and April 1648. The Red Fort has an area of 254.67 acres (103.06 ha) enclosed by 2.41 kilometres (1.50 mi) of defensive walls, punctuated by turrets and bastions that vary in height from 18 metres (59 ft) on the 
river side to 33 metres (108 ft) on the city side. The fort is octagonal, with the north–south axis longer than the east–west axis. The marble, floral decorations and the fort's double domes exemplify later Mughal architecture. It showcases a high level of ornamentation, and the Kohinoor diamond was reportedly part of 
the furnishings. The fort's artwork synthesises Persian, European and Indian art, resulting in a unique Shahjahani style rich in form, expression and colour. Red Fort is one of the building complexes of India encapsulating a long period of history and its arts. Even before its 1913 commemoration as a monument of national
importance, efforts were made to preserve it for posterity.On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian "tricolour flag" at the fort's main gate and delivers
a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.

It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656 at a cost of one million rupees, and was inaugurated by Imam Syed Abdul Ghafoor Shah Bukhari from Bukhara, present-day Uzbekistan.
The mosque was completed in 1656 AD with three great gates and two 40 metres high minarets constructed with strips of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate more than 25000 people. There are three domes on the terrace which are surrounded by the two minarets. On the floor, a total
of 899 black borders are marked for worshippers. The architectural plan of Badshahi Masjid, built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb at Lahore, Pakistan, is similar to the Jama Masjid.
