Jaipur  is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. It was founded in 1727 by Jai Singh II, the King of Amer who ruled from
1699 to 1743. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also known as the
Pink City, due to the dominant colour scheme of its buildings. It was constructed within a period of four years and Jaipur is the only city that has
been planned as per rules & regulations of the Vaastu shastra and the Shilpa Shastras. It is located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital
New Delhi. Jaipur was founded in 1727 by the Rajput ruler Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named. It was one of the earliest
planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. During the British Colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State.
After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made capital of the newly-formed state of Rajasthan. Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India and
forms a part of the west Golden Triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra (240 km, 149 mi). It also serves as a gateway to other tourist
destinations in Rajasthan such as Jodhpur (348 km, 216 mi), Jaisalmer (571 km, 355 mi), Udaipur (421 km, 262 mi), Kota (252 km, 156 mi) and
Mount Abu (520 km, 323 mi). Jaipur is located 616 km from Shimla. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Jaipur the
‘Pink City of India’ among its World Heritage Sites. The city is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Amber Fort and Jantar Mantar.

Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq. mi), located
11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The town of Amer and the Amber Fort were originally built by the Meena’s, and later it
was ruled by Raja Man Singh I. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur. Amer Fort is known for its artistic style elements.
With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake, which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.
It was constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the
Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the
Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also
popularly known as the Amer Palace. The palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near
the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he
defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh). Raja Man Singh had 12 queens so he made 12 rooms, one for each
Queen. Each room had a staircase connected to the King’s room Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid

Hawa Mahal is built from red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's
chambers.The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur.
 He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five 
floor exterior is akin to honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice
 design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the 
strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the
 Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.<br><br>

 It provides an excellent of view of Aravalli hills and the Amer Fort down below. The fort was built by Jai Singh II in 1726 to protect the Amer Fort and
 its palace complex and was named after him.The fort, rugged and similar in structural design to the Amer Fort, is also known as Victory Fort. It has a
 length of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) along the north–south direction and a width of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). The fort features a cannon named "Jaivana"
(Jaivana Cannon), which was manufactured in the fort precincts and was then the world's largest cannon on wheels. Jaigarh Fort and Amer Fort are
 connected by subterranean passages and considered as one complex.<br><br>

The name jantar is derived from yantra a Sanskrit word, meaning "instrument, machine", and mantar from mantrana also a Sanskrit word "calculate".
 Therefore, Jantar Mantar literally means 'calculating instrument'. It is a collection of nineteen architectural astronomical instruments built by the 
Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh I, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, 
and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions
 with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations. The monument
 features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial 
system, and the ecliptic system. The kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation of the coordinates directly
 from one system to the other. The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of 
Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for the Jaipur District. <br><br>

Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and
 Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. The fort was originally named sudarshangarh, but it became known as
 Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and 
obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his 
name.<br><br>

The City Palace, Jaipur was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his court to Jaipur from 
Amber, in 1727. Jaipur is the present-day capital of the state of Rajasthan, and until 1949 the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat
of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The Palace was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts, commerce, and industry. It 
now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, and continues to be the home of the Jaipur royal family. The royal family of Jaipur is said to 
be the descendants of Lord Rama. The palace complex has several buildings, various courtyards, galleries, restaurants, and offices of the Museum 
Trust. The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum Trust looks after the Museum, and the royal cenotaphs (known as chhatris).<br><br>

Jal Mahal, meaning "Water Palace" is a palace in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur city, the capital of the state of Rajasthan, India. The
 palace and the lake around it were renovated and enlarged in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber.The Jal Mahal palace is an 
architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in Rajasthan) on a grand scale. The building has a picturesque view of the lake
 itself but owing to its seclusion from land is equally the focus of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the
 backdrop of the surrounding Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built-in red sandstone, is a five storied building, of which four floors remain
 underwater when the lake is full and the top floor is exposed. One rectangular Chhatri on the roof is of the Bengal type. The chhatris on the four 
corners are octagonal. The palace had suffered subsidence in the past and also partial seepage (plasterwork and wall damage equivalent to rising 
damp) because of waterlogging, which have been repaired under a restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.<br><br>
